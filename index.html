			<h2 class="site-text">Who?</h2>
      <p class="site-text site-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Draft is a UChicago-based, non-profit organization that seeks to bring after-school mentorship programs in creative 
				writing to high schools in underprivileged areas of Chicago. In addition to the program, this website is an online publication that allows 
				all of our students to publish their works and let others hear their voices.
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every member and mentor of The First Draft are University of Chicago undergraduate students who want to make a difference in their community. 
				Our mentors come from diverse backgrounds, and all of them have something different to bring to the classroom from their diverse experiences
				and passions.
			</p>
			<h2 class="site-text">How?</h2>
      <p class="site-text site-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We send mentors to schools with whom we partner in different areas of Chicago. Based on the students, 
				their experiences with writing, and the school, we design a curriculum that would fit the specific student body the best. We work closely
				 with the partnering schools to make sure that the students and the school can have the best experience possible with us. Our mentors give
				hands-on guidance to the students and serve as resources for the young writers to put their thoughts on paper. 
				</p>
			<h2 class="site-text">Why?</h2>
			<p class="site-text site-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although writing is one of the most important skills anyone could have, especially
				 for students who are aiming for higher education, it is often heavily undertaught in public school systems around the country. We want to
					help fill that need for students who want to become better writers, voice their opinions, or turn their creativity into a presentable 
					form. Many teenagers have their own stories to tell, but they may lack the resources to tell them or don’t know how to express them. Our
					 goal is to help them tell their stories.</p>
			<h2 class="site-text">Mission:</h2>
			<p class="site-text site-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide a space and an opportunity for students of all ages in the underprivileged areas of Chicago 
				to express their ideas through creative writing and foster a passion for reading and writing fiction.</p>

          <h3>Eric Meng</h3>
          <p id="member-paragraph">I am a second year at the University of Chicago, majoring in economics and psychology. 
						I co-founded The First Draft for two main reasons. I love creative writing. After taking a creative writing course my first year, 
						I realized this is a great activity that allows me to express my ideas through other characters and see what I write come together 
						as a story that others can enjoy as well. The second reason is that I want to extend this passion of mine to give an opportunity and 
						safe space for kids from disadvantaged backgrounds to do the same. I have talked to these high school students who want to learn to 
						write creatively and express their feelings and thoughts without judgments but lack the opportunity to do so. They  ultimately 
						motivated me to carry this project out. A fun fact about me is that I enjoy traveling to other countries to experience different 
						cultures. I have been to around 30 countries so far and hope to continue to add to this total.

          <p id="member-paragraph">I am a second year at the University of Chicago majoring in Psychology and minoring in Creative Writing. 
						I co-founded this organization with Eric Meng as a way to promote the values of safe spaces and free expression through creative 
						writing. This skill is extremely undertaught in high schools across America, and I want to help provide students a way to express all 
						of their ideas and thoughts without any censorship or judgments. I can’t wait to be able to hear the amazing stories and creativity 
						produced by the students that go through this program. A quick fun fact about me is that I am also a PADI certified rescue scuba diver, 
						and that I am three registered dives away from being a PADI certified master diver.
